# ETHEREUM PET SHOP

http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop

used ganache as a test node
https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache

After completing the tutorial also added a disown button which would 'unadopt' a pet.

Issues:
- Ganache would crash randomly and then metamask would give an unkown nonce error.
  - Had to reinstall ganache and metamask to continue.
- Truffle would sometimes get confused as to the number of parameters a function needed.  
  - To fix the build folder would have to be deleted and everything recompiled.
